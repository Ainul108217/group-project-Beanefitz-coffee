            <p>I really like the atmosphere, good coffee, and nice interior. This is a good place to study or chill with friends. The drinks and foods were all tasty and worthwhile. If you’re up for a fresh place with beautiful architecture then this is a must to visit. The barista was so friendly and pleasant to talk with. One thing that I got fascinated by this place. They had the most affordable and delicious coffee in town.</p>

           <p> If you’re looking for a place where to relax and read some novels or whatever, this coffee shop would be the best. They have the best coffee available and even some fresh baked goods as well. The ambiance of this shop was so relaxing, and the staffs are highly capable. I could not ask for more because everything that I needed was provided. Well done, guys! Keep making great coffee and pastries!</p>
